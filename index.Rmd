## Why use the Citibike Availability App?

1. It's easy to find stations
2. Get realtime availability status
3. Avoid frustration

## Finding Stations

The map on the citibike website and app can get cluttered.

## Get Realtime Updates

Both my "Citibike Availability App" and the official citibike app deliver realtime updates regarding the availability of bikes at specific stations.

---

## Avoid Frustration

However, understanding patterns in a specific station's activity would help you determine the likelyhood that a bike is available when you want one.

---

## Enter the Citibike Availability App!

Find stations, get realtime station information AND understand trends in a station's activity level! The "Trends in Availability" plot depicts the flow of bikes to and from the satation and ultimately helps you avoid walking to an empty station!
